# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

A deep learning project that detects whether a tomato plant is healthy or infected, and identifies the specific type of disease using image classification.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Tomato crops are vulnerable to a variety of leaf diseases, which can reduce yield and quality if not treated early. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify tomato leaf images into 10 categories — including healthy leaves and 9 common diseases.

## 🎯 Goals

- Detect if a tomato leaf is healthy or infected
- Classify the specific disease from a set of known categories
- Build a lightweight, user-friendly model for real-world application
